Note: I am currently in the process of transferring content FROM the document, "DRAFT_QAPP_KenaiRiverWatershed_Baseline_20220824.docx," TO the document "qapp_draft_4.1.docx."

The original QAPP I inherited was in PDF form. When converted to MS word, formatting was a mess and had no hyperlinks. The hyperlinks are needed
for keeping track of appendices, figures, tables, references, etc.
