The document "Standard Export 9673" is downloaded from the Ambient Water Quality Monitoring System (AWQMS), which has a publically acessible portal at
 https://awqms2.goldsystems.com/Login.aspx (login "akpublic", no password). 

This download file contains all known data associated with Kenai Watershed Forum that is housed in AWQMS as of 2/14/2022. The content housed in 
AWQMS may differ at a future date and may contain more or less data. As a result, these data are provisional. A more permanent, stable source
for data is the EPA Water Quality Portal.

AWQWMS is the "staging ground" that the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation uses to house and prepare data as it is being reviewed for
potential submission to the EPA Water Quality Exchange, where it is then housed in the EPA Water Quality Portal.
