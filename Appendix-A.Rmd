# Appendix: Data Uplift to EPA WQX

## Introduction

Prior to analysis and interpretation of water quality data, we will ensure that all data meeting QA/QC standards outlined in the QAPP is accessible in the appropriate repository. Water quality data for this project is stored in the EPA Water Quality Exchange (EPA WQX), formerly EPA STORET.


```{r, notes}

# course of action

# uplift 2021 data

# audit existing data in WQX

# attempt to download missing data from  AQWMS

# if not available, reshape data from shared drive to uplift to EPA WQX (big task)

```

## 2021 Baseline Water Quality Data



```{r, other notes, include = F}

# ultimately, would like to set up auto query of EPA WQX so this report updates automatically (github actions or other methods...?); eg see front matter guts of https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/.

```
