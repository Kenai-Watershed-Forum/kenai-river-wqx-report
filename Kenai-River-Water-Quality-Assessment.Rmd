# (APPENDIX) Appendix {.unnumbered}

# Appendix: Data Review and Uplift

## Introduction

Prior to analysis and interpretation of water quality data, we will ensure that all data that meets QA/QC standards outlined in the current project [Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)](https://paperpile.com/app/p/7703451b-460d-00b4-82a0-1086ea2554c3) is accessible in the appropriate repository.

Water quality data from this project is ultimately destined for the EPA Water Quality Exchange (EPA WQX), formerly EPA STORET. The process of transferring these data to the higher-level EPA repository is referred to as data "uplift."

Section B10 of the 2020 QAPP describes data management details and responsible parties for each step of the data pipeline from observation to repository. The 2021 data preparation and review process is published here as an appendix as an example of the process applied annually to each year's data.

### 2021 Water Quality Data

In this appendix we will collate laboratory data from several sources into a single spreadsheet document with a consistent format. The format consists of a spreadsheet template provided by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), referred to here as the AQWMS Template:

```{r, echo = F}
xfun::embed_file('other/input/AQWMS/AWQMS_KWF_Baseline_2021.xlsx', text = "Download the AQWMS Water Quality Data Spreadsheet Template")
```

AWQMS is an acronym for "Ambient Water Quality Management System," the service used by ADEC to manage and prepare data for potential uplift to the EPA WQX.

#### 2021 Water Quality Data AQWMS Formatting

The code scripts below assemble water quality data from the three analytical laboratories that partnered with Kenai Watershed Forum for this project in 2021:

-   SGS Laboratories (Anchorage, AK)

-   Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (Soldotna, AK)

-   Taurianen Engineering and Testing (Soldotna, AK)

############### Part C: Address spelling/format issues and inconsistent sample/site names ######################

# Upon visual inspection of site names, we can see that the location names in the AQWMS template differ slightly from the place names in the SGS report (spelling and name inconsistencies).


# 3/28/2022 - A note on addressing "Duplicate" designations. In QA/QC data review in March 2022 the following was clarified through trial and error: we must make a careful distinction between "Field Duplicates" and "Lab duplicates" when preparing this data. The sample names contain info about whether a result is from a "Field Duplicate," e.g., two field collections made at the same location/day/time. However the ALS lab also created "Lab Duplicates," which are not from the same sites as field duplicates, and designates these as "DUP1" in the "sample_type" column.

# See AQWMS Activity Type column assign distinctions

# Decision - we will designate the field duplicates simply as a Field Duplicate


# move info about duplicate sample and/or sample blank status into separate column, "sample_condition"
dat %<>%
  mutate(sample_condition = case_when(
    grepl("Method Blank",sample) ~ "Method Blank",
    grepl("Trip Blank",sample) ~ "Trip Blank",
    grepl("DUP",sample) ~ "Field Duplicate",
    grepl("Dup",sample) ~ "Field Duplicate")) %>%
  # remove "DUP" designation from sample column
  mutate(sample = str_replace(sample, "DUP|Dup", "")) 

  
# remove from "sample" names the text containing the suffixes Diss/Dis (Dissolved metals sample) since we only  want location info in this column. (Solution for this step was found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29271549/replace-all-occurrences-of-a-string-in-a-data-frame)
dat %<>%  
  mutate(sample = (str_replace(sample, "Diss|Dis|DUP|Dup",""))) %>%
  
  # remove "Diss" suffix and "EP" prefix from "analytical_method" column
  mutate(analytical_method = str_replace(analytical_method, "Diss", "")) %>%
  # note trailing space after "EP200.8 "
  mutate(analytical_method = str_replace(analytical_method,"EP200.8 ","200.8")) %>%

  # address the one stubborn site name still containing "Diss"

    sample == "RM0-No Name Creek  Diss" ~ "RM0-No Name Creek",
    TRUE ~ sample)) 
  
# z <- dat %>%
#  select(sample,sample_type,sample_condition)

  
# We need to remove white spaces, apostrophes, and dashes; because join functions such as "left_join" are often uncooperative with these types of string characters. We will need to use joins with site names in next steps.

############## Part D: Prepare SGS/ALS Location/Site Names ##########################

# NOTE: The SGS and ALS 2021 results have a variety of misspelling and typos. For 2022, we should provide labs with a csv file of site names that they can use

# In preparation for a join to AQWMS table, we will manually generate a match table csv file that we can use 

## generate list of unique site names from 2021 SGS data
sgs21_sitenames <- data.table(unique(dat$sample)) %>%
  arrange(V1)
  

# generate list of unique site names from 2021 AQWMS template. these are the names we want in the final product

# create an excel file with two sheets: a.) SGS site names, and b.) AQWMS site names
wb <- loadWorkbook(site_match_table_path)
addWorksheet(wb,"Sheet2")
writeData(wb,"Sheet2",aqwms21_sitenames)
saveWorkbook(wb,site_match_table_path,overwrite = TRUE)


# Using these two tables, we will manually create a new file titled "sgs_site_names_matching_table_manual_edit.xlsx" and manually match up the two disparate naming systems. 

# Performed manually by B Meyer March 18, 2022.

# append "Monitoring Location Name" and "Monitoring Location ID" info from WQX to spring 2021 SGS data

## read in site names join table
sitenames21_match <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/sgs_site_names_matching_table_manual_edit.xlsx") %>%

  clean_names()

# remove dfs
rm(sgs21_sitenames,aqwms21_sitenames,sitenames21_match)



######################## Part E: "Result Analytical Method Context" name rectification ######################

# In the AQWMS template, the EPA names that will go in the column "Result Analytical Method ID" do not exactly match the names provided by the laboratory (SGS). After communicating with SGS and DEC on 2/8/2022, we are able to cross-walk between the two naming systems. These matches are documented in the excel file "analysis_code_matching_table.xlsx."

########################## Miscellaneous Steps #########################################


########### Address Non-Detect values #########################

# Non-detect values should be left blank. A non-detect does not necessarily mean there was a zero observation of an analyte in a sample, it could be just be present at a level lower than the method detection level (lower than what the lab equipment can detect). Instead of 0, we’ll leave it blank. The Practical Quantitation Limit (or Limit of Quantitation) is presented alongside the result. When DEC evaluates a waterbody, they’ll use ½ the PQL as a stand-in for a non-detect. See explanatory document at other/documents/references/SGS DL, LOD, LOQ Interpretation.pdf for more details.

# modify non-detect values from "0" to "NA" if resultflag = U or ND
dat %<>%
  mutate(result1 = na_if(result,0)) %>%
  select(-result) %>%
  rename(result = result1)


###### Segregate laboratory QA/QC data from field data ########
# These data will be evaluated at a later step. See excel file "other/input/AQWMS/sample_type_abbreviations_manual_edit.xlsx" for sample_type naming schema
sgs21_als21_qaqc_dat <- dat %>%
    # retain only results not from field sampling program (project samples and trip blanks)
    # also filter out hydrocarbon surrogate results ("surr"). Surrogate standards are compounds spiked into all samples, blanks, Laboratory Control Samples, and matrix spikes to monitor the efficacy of sample extraction, chromatographic, and calibration systems. They do not represent environmental observations.

When DEC evaluates a waterbody, they’ll use ½ the PQL as a stand-in for a non-detect. See explanatory document at other/documents/references/SGS DL, LOD, LOQ Interpretation.pdf for more details.

*Additional Miscellaneous Code Used to Prepare Data For AQWMS Template*

</summary>

```{r}

############### Miscellaneous Steps for Overall Field Results Dataframe #################


############# a.)  filter out lab blanks and positive lab controls ##################
#dat %<>%
#  filter(!sample_condition %in% c("Lab Blank","Positive Control")) # should already be gone now 3/4/22


############ b.) match latitude and longitude coordinates to sites ##################

## read in coordinates
site_coords <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/AQWMS_template_matching_table.xlsx", sheet = "site_coordinates") %>%
  remove_empty()

## join coords to overall df
dat <- left_join(dat,site_coords)


############ c.) assign "result sample fraction" (e.g. filtered, dissolved, etc.) ############

## read in manually organized table that pairs "result sample fraction" with "analytical method"
result_sample_fraction <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/AQWMS_template_matching_table.xlsx", sheet = "result_sample_fraction") %>%
  filter(!is.na(analytical_method)) %>%
  select(-description)

## join to table
dat <- left_join(dat,result_sample_fraction)



################ d.) assign "result detection condition"##############

## read in manually assigned join table
result_detection_condition <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/AQWMS_template_matching_table.xlsx", sheet = "result_detection_condition") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(resultflag))

## join to table
## z <- dat %>% left_join(dat,result_detection_condition, by = "resultflag")

## the attempt at left_join above is exhibiting nonsensical result for unclear reason. For now, define programmatically:

dat %<>%
  mutate(result_detection_condition = case_when(
    resultflag == "U" | resultflag == "ND" ~ "Not Detected",
    resultflag == "J" ~ "Present Below Quantification Limit"))


############### e.) assign chemical preservative type ################

## read in table
chemical_preservative <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/AQWMS_template_matching_table.xlsx", sheet = "chemical_preservative") %>%
  filter(!is.na(preservative)) %>%
  select(-description)

## join to overall dataframe
dat <- left_join(dat,chemical_preservative)


############# f.) assign bottle type and color ######################

## read in table
bottle_type_color <- read_excel("other/input/AQWMS/AQWMS_template_matching_table.xlsx", sheet = "sample_container_type_color") %>%
  select(-description) %>%
  filter(!is.na(sample_container_type))

## join to overall dataframe
dat <- left_join(dat,bottle_type_color)

rm(site_coords, result_sample_fraction, result_detection_condition, chemical_preservative, bottle_type_color)



############ g.) assign "Statistical Base Code" column ##############

# this value is not applicable to most results here, usually left blank. will assign "count": to fecal coliform

dat %<>%
  mutate(stat_base_code = case_when(
    analyte == "Fecal Coliform" ~ "Count"
  ))


########### f.) "Activity ID" code shortening ######################

# The Activity ID column consists of concatenating the columns (`Monitoring Location ID`,"-",collect_date,"-",analyte,"-", sample_condition). This field is permitted to be no longer than 55 characters. With full names of analytes included, the entries sometimes exceed 55 characters. 

# To address this, we will do two things: 
## a.) use analyte abbreviations: for single elements, we will use their periodic table abbreviation. TBD for other analytes.
## b.) use abbreviations for sample_condition (designations of field blank or field dup)

## a.) analyte abbreviations
# export list of unique analytes from 2021 data
write.csv(data.frame(unique(dat$analyte)),"other/input/AQWMS/analytes_list.csv", row.names = F)

# manually assign abbreviations for each analyte in the sister file "analytes_list_manual_edit.csv"

# re-import edited list of analyte abbreviation names, then append to dataframe. Use in later step when creating Activity IDs.
analyte_abbrev <- read.csv("other/input/AQWMS/analytes_list_manual_edit.csv")
colnames(analyte_abbrev) <- c("analyte","analyte_abbreviation")
dat %<>%
  left_join(analyte_abbrev)
```

```{r}
## b.) sample_condition abbreviations
dat %<>%
  mutate(sample_condition_abbrv = case_when(
    sample_condition == "Field Duplicate" ~ "DUP",
    sample_condition == "Trip Blank" ~ "Blank"))

### Data Evaluation

Prior to submission to ADEC, all water quality data must be checked against a series of standard questions in order to evaluate how quality assurance / quality check (QA/QC) processes are instituted. The draft Data Evaluation Checklist Template (available for download below) outlines these questions:

# This code chunk will prepare values to be used in addressing the data review questions below. 

# The code will be executed here (prior to the review questions) rather than in individual chunks above each individual question, because some of the questions are not sequentially independent. (That is to say, values from multiple questions are needed to answer single questions, sometimes from prior and sometimes from after a particular question. For example in question #4, we want to know how many values we excluded from the whole original dataset, which requires decisions based on questions following question #5). Ideally, one day, we would have these questions in the sequence most logical for data analysis.

# Question 1.: No calculations needed.
# Question 2.: No calculations needed.
# Question 3.: No calculations needed.

# Question 4. Dataset Completeness: Calculations Needed


#################################### Question 4 Data Prep and Calculations #########################################

## 4.1: Completeness Measure A: "the primary number of samples collected divided by the useable number of samples submitted to ADEC with a goal of 85% completeness."

## 4.2: Completeness Measure B: "the planned number of samples divided by the useable samples (submitted to ADEC) with a goal of 60%."

## Include parameter information, number of expected samples, number of collected samples and overall percent completeness

### Note: This question relies on the QA/QC process itself to be complete before answering it. We will need to complete all of the following questions before we can answer question 4. Here, we will prepare the numerator values for both of the above definitions of completeness, and acquire the denominator values once QA/QC is complete.

### calculate values needed for completeness

# general approach: create count table of collected results in originally prepared aqwms file (prior to QA/QC).

### For question 4.1: the number of samples collected
### First: get number of samples (results) actually collected
### by parameter

# note: Put this text in when addressing questions 4.1 and 4.2: From the above table we can see that there are deviations between planned and actual results available. These deviations are attributable to two causes:

# Cause 1: The Spring 2021 Chain of Custody from KWF to SGS was completed erroneously. The COC specified for 200.8 analyses to be complete for all sites (when they should have stopped upstream of Morgan's Landing RM31), and it also specified for 200.7 analyses to stop upstream of Morgan's Landing (when they should have been performed for all sites in the project).

# Cause 2: For Summer 2021, the SGS performed the 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free.)

# TO DO::: once data that does not pass QC muster is flagged and removed, we will append an additional column(s) to the tables generatede in questions 4.1 and 4.2

<br>

2.  [**Was the data collected representative of environmental conditions?**]{.ul} *Yes*. Notes: Study design is intended to create two single-day snapshots, one in spring and another in summer, across a wide geographical area of the Kenai River watershed.

<br>

3.  [**Are site names, dates, and times correct and as expected?**]{.ul} *Yes, after post-season correction documented in this report.* Notes: In 2021 Kenai Watershed Forum used pre-printed labels on all sample bottles, reducing opportunity for field and lab transcription errors. Remaining site name transcription errors were corrected in post-season data review.

<br>

4.  [**Is the dataset complete and did you receive the expected number of results?**]{.ul} *TBD*. Notes: we acquired the expected number of results in 2021 sampling events. All sites described in the QAPP were visited twice in 2021, and all water sample collections were successfully conducted. However most intrinsic water quality parameters mentioned in the current QAPP were not collected in 2021.

Data evaluation is currently in progress. The values in the downloadable table below are current as of `r Sys.Date()`. The numerator values of "Samples Submitted to ADEC" and "Usable Samples" are not yet finalized and will depend on feedback received from DEC as part of this pre-database review process.

    -   Completeness Measure B = (Planned Number of Results) / (Useable Number of Results) \* 100%

        -   Project goal: ***60%***

        -   Calculated project completeness Measure B: Varies by parameter, see downloadable file below. *These values will be updated as revisions from DEC dictate the number of usable (publishable) samples.*

```


From the above downloadable table, "Planned vs. Actual Trip Blank and Field Duplicate Samples for 2021," we observe that data from one field duplicate sample is missing. The missing sample is for the 200.7 (total metals) analyses on 2021-05-11 at RM 31 (Morgan's Landing). This error occurred due to a transcription error on the chain of custody form, and the lab did not process a total metals analysis for this site/event.

-   View duplicate RPD calculations and a summary table in supporting excel file; including parameters, site names, dates, results, and RPD values: ***Download Table Below***

    -   Note: we applied standards from ADEC to determine which observations may be evaluated in RPD calculations. From ADEC 2022, *"Estimated values (detected at levels lower than the practical quantitation limit (PQL)) were treated as non-detects for the purpose of this analysis. A set of paired samples was evaluated for RPD only if:*

        -   *one or both of the samples were above the PQL;*

        -   *one or both of the samples were at least two times the PQL."*

```

The above table indicates that **two** RPD values were outside of acceptable QA/QC ranges (>20% RPD). An inquiry has been emailed to ADEC on `r Sys.Date()` on how best to apply this criteria, and how it will affect the extent of the finalized dataset.

7.  Were there any issues with instrument calibration? ***No***. Did the instrument perform as expected? ***Yes***. Notes: ***The sole in-situ field measurement type recorded in 2021 was for water temperature.***

8.  Was instrument calibration performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations? ***Yes***. Were calibration logs or records kept? ***Yes***. Notes: ***Instrument calibration records are available upon request at [hydrology\@kenaiwatershed.org](mailto:hydrology@kenaiwatershed.org){.email}***.

9.  Was instrument verification during the field season performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations? ***NA*** . Were verification logs or records kept? ***No logger instruments were deployed, thus no verification checks were performed.***.

10. Do the instrument data files site IDs, time stamps and file names match? ***No logger instruments were deployed, thus no instrument data files were generated.***.

11. Is any field data rejected and why? ***Yes. As of this raw data review last updated on `r Sys.Date()`, the RPD value for Total Phosphorus on 5/11/2021 from the site "KR RM 31" is 77.03%, well above the project precision goal for this parameter of 20%. Additionally, the RPD value for fecal coliform on 5/11/2021 at the site "KR RM 0 NNC" is 51.4%, however this parameter doe snot have overall project accuracy or precision goals according to the current QAPP.***.

##### Analytical Laboratory Reports and Results

12. Do the laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters? ***Yes. The laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters specified in the Chains of Custody. However in one case, a transcription error on the chain of custody form for SGS labs in Spring 2021 resulted in missing result values for the method 200.7 analyses (Total Metals) from 2021-05-11 at RM 31 (Morgan's Landing)***.

13. Were the appropriate analytical methods used for all parameters? ***Yes***.

14. Do the laboratory reports match the COC and requested methods? ***Yes***. Are same methods used throughout? ***Yes***.

15. Are the number of samples on the laboratory reports the same as on the COC? ***Yes***.

16. Is a copy of the COC included with the laboratory reports? ***Yes***.

17. Were preservation, hold time and temperature requirements met? ***Yes. Summer and Spring 2021 holding time requirements were met for all samples. See downloadable files below. Laboratory result documents indicated no compromises of preservation and temperature requirements.***

```{r hold-times, echo = F, messages = F, warnings = F}

# embed for download
xfun::embed_file("other/input/AQWMS/sample_holding_times.csv", text = "Download Table of Maximum Holding Times for Each Sample Type")
```

# embed for download
xfun::embed_file("other/output/field_qa_qc_data/holding_time_calcs.csv", text = "Download Holding Time Calculations for Spring and Summer 2021 Field Samples")

```

18. Are there any project specific concerns (e.g. total v. dissolved, MST, etc)? ***Yes. Communication with the ADEC office in Winter 2022 includes the recommendation to modify field practices with relation to dissolved metals sampling. These practices include a.) filtering samples in lab rather than in the field, and b.) incorporating a field blank for dissolved metals. These practices are integrated into the project as of summer 2022 and will be reflected in the QAPP, currently in the process of being updated***.

19. Was all supporting info provided in the laboratory report, such as reporting limits for all analyses and definitions? ***Yes, see raw results in previous section***.

20. Were there any laboratory discrepancies, errors, data qualifiers, or QC failures (review laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes and blanks)? ***Yes. These laboratory-identified discrepancies are outlined in detail below. As of `r Sys.Date()` we would like to consult with ADEC to determine if these laboratory-identified discrepancies are grounds for rejecting field observations***.

# calculate qa/qc discrepancies as detailed in PDF reports check qapp for guidance, or check w/ qa officer...

matrix_spike_limits <- read.csv("other/output/lab_qaqc_data/2021_lab_qaqc_data/sgs21_als21_qaqc_dat.csv") %>%
  select(lab_name,sample,collect_date,extracted_date,sample_type,result,analyte,dissolved,analytical_method,

```

</details>

The following discrepancies were identified in the results from SGS laboratories:

###### Matrix Spike Recoveries

A total of `r matrix_spike_recovery_fails` matrix spike or matrix spike duplicate samples are outside of QC criteria. The limit of recovery range for the analyte "Total Nitrate/Nitrite-N" is 90% - 110%. For these matrix spike measurements outside of the QC criteria, recovery levels range from 112% - 118%.

# embed for download
xfun::embed_file("other/output/lab_qaqc_data/matrix_spike_recovery_fails.csv", text = "Download Matrix Spike Recovery Values Exceeding Threshold for Spring and Summer 2021 Field Samples")

```

No additional lab QA/QC anomalies for any other parameters were noted by any laboratories contracted in 2021, including lab duplicates and lab blanks. Additional details are available upon request at [hydrology\@kenaiwatershed.org](mailto:hydrology@kenaiwatershed.org){.email}.


###### Total vs Dissolved Metals
We will verify that the quantity of total metals is less than that of dissolved metals... [in progress]

```{r, echo = F}

z <- dat %>%
  filter(`Result Analytical Method ID` == c("200.7","200.8")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Result Value`)) %>%
  group_by(`Monitoring Location ID`,`Activity Start Date`,`Result Unit`,`Result Analytical Method ID`) %>%
  summarise(method_sum = sum(`Result Value`)) %>%
  mutate(method_sum_ug = case_when(
    `Result Unit`== "mg/L" ~ method_sum/1000,
    TRUE ~ method_sum
  )) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-`Result Unit`,-method_sum) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Result Analytical Method ID`,values_from = method_sum_ug)

# note mg vs ug
```


21. Is any laboratory data rejected and why? ***Yes, see question 6 on Relative Percent Difference values***.

22. Was the QA Officer consulted for any data concerns? ***We are communicating with the Soldotna ADEC office for this data submission. We will schedule a meeting with the QA office with their coordination when appropriate***.
